## Installation

Just fetch the latest ZIP from the [release section](https://github.com/robbertkl/LeanBack/releases) and put the extracted app into your Applications folder.

You might need to disable OS X Gatekeeper to run it: *System Preferences* > *Security & Privacy* > *General* tab > *Allow apps downloaded from: Anywhere*.
